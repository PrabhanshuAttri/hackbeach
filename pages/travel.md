## By Bus

### From Goa

Bus Route - Goa - (Madgao) - Karwar - Ankola - Gokarna.

Just keep saying 'Gokarna' to the bus conductors and they will hop you in and drop you out from where you will get the next bus to Gokarna. Its an interesting journey to do in the day if you have about 4-6 hours to spare.
