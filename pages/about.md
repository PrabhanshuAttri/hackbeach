hackbeach is held every year in different spots along the Indian coast.

People from different places, walks of life and lines of thought come together
to share, collaborate and learn.

Hackers talk code. Artists share their creativity. Students join in from
schools and colleges to learn new skills. Locals and globals mix and mingle.
We build things like tables, hula hoops, interactive art installations, and
solar lanterns. We connect. We dance and sing. Ideas emerge. Collaborations
form. Lives change.

In the hacking, we get hacked ourselves.

### Philosophy

hackbeach is passionate about making, sharing, learning, and the broad concepts
of open source. Freedom, security, and environmentalism are also key to
hackbeachers. All of our ideas have conjoined into something exceptionally
creative.

We are just a bunch of people that got connected by crazy and various
circumstances, in a spontaneous and still very dynamic way. Many hackbeachers
changed direction in life thanks to interactions during hackbeach - starting
school, quitting jobs, moving house, launching projects.

hackbeach is inclusive. Being Excellent to Each Other is a core component of
hackbeach. Everyone is welcome, regardless of economic background, race,
religion, caste, nationality, political view, gender, and age.
